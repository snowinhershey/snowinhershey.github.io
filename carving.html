<p>Mindful practice is a process that help us to understand nature, world, and ourselves. </p>

<p> The first few days in June, 2018, I came up with this idea of doing some carving artwork. I started from the regular paper. 
The first design came to my mind was a "rose". I once had some classes on design using nail polish. Here is my first attempt.</p>

<p> I was then received some feedback that it doesn't look like a real rose. I then realised that carving artwork should not be limited to
one paper, one color, and one layer. My second design is the dandelion flowers. It was not the season for dandelion flowers. You can see 
dandelion almost everywhere in late April and ealy May. Also, dandelion can be used as herbal medicine. I then worked on my second attempt.</p>

<p> It is still one of my favorite design.</p>
