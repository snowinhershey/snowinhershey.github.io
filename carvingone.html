<p> I started the carving from the flower. I don't know the name of this flower.
I might get this idea from drawing Chinese roses. I tried many times to draw rose when I was a child. 
No positive feedback was given to me. Well...who care? I still keep trying.
What is important to me is "To observe, to understand, and then to express." </p>
