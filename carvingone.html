<h1> First Attempt: Carving Flower </h1>

<p> I started the carving from the flower. I don't know the name of this flower.
I may get the idea of drawing Chinese rose. I tried many times to draw rose when I was a child 
No positive feedback was given to me since then. Well...who care? I am still tying to create.
What is important to me is "To observe, to understand, and then to express." </p>
